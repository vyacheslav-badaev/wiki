## Import starter
[https://github.com/forestryio/jamdocs](https://github.com/forestryio/jamdocs "https://github.com/forestryio/jamdocs")
## Start Instant Previews
This starter is pre-configured, but you will need to manually start the preview environement if you want to be able to preview your documents.
Go to **Settings / Preview** and click on the **Start** button.
It will clone your site on Forestry preview environment, install the project dependencies, and launch your npm script to launch `gridsome develop`
!
Once the server is started, you will be able to **click on the preview icon** when you're editing a document (even without saving your changes).
## Adding pages
Go in the docs section and click **Create** to add a new page to your documentation. The default front matter template contains `title`, `date` and `slug`fields. You can add new ones by editing the front matter template.
## Front matter
You can edit the **Documention Page** front matter template by cliking on **Front Matter** in the sidebar. From here you can add new fields to enhance the current template.

## Managing sidebar topics
Click on the **Menu** section in Forestry to add a new section or topics from the user interface. Forestry will write the changes to the JSON file. ðŸŽ‰
