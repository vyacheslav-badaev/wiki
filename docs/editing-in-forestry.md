## Start Instant Previews
This starter is pre-configured, but you will need to manually start the preview environement if you want to be able to preview your documents.
Go to **Settings / Preview** and click on the **Start** button.
It will clone your site on Forestry preview environment, install the project dependencies, and launch your npm script to launch `gridsome develop`
Once the server is started, you will be able to **click on the preview icon** when you're editing a document (even without saving your changes).
## Add a new page
Go in the docs section and click **Create** to add a new page to your documentation. The default front matter template contains title, date and slug. You can edit the **Documention Page** front matter template by cliking on **Front Matter** in the sidebar.
